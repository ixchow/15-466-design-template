	<h1>Slippery Quest</h1>
	<p>This game is inspired by
		<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rocket_Hideout">Rocket Hideout Maze</a>
		from the famous game Pokemon, featuring boost spots, teleportation gates, traps and bonus points</p>

	<i>Some paragraghs are adapted from sample document (Stickoshet Robot).</i>
	<p>The game is played on a 32 x 32 (board sizes are subject to change) board viewed from above. Tiles on the board may contain
		walls, goals, boost spots, teleportation gates, traps, and slippery ice tiles. The player uses the arrow keys to control 
		his/her character, with the aim of collecting any bonus points and then finally arriving at the goal. Once the player arrives
		at the goal, a new challenge is randomly generated. The player can replay the level for many times, and his/her finishing
		time will be diplayed and recorded. In order to motivate player pursuing the fastest solution.</p>

	<h2>Gameplay</h2>

	<p>
		<b>Start:</b> Player's character, the target point and bonus points will be placed at random positions in the board. And the
		other tiles of the boards will be initialized as other possible tile categories. The generation process will garantee that
		There will be finally at least one possible route for player to reach the end point, with all the bonus points collected.
		</p>

	<p>At the beginning of the game, player will be given 15 seconds to observe the board and then figure out the shortest path
		to reach the destination, with collecting bonus points as many as possible. The player can press the
		<b>space</b>key to start the game at any time he/she wants, or the game will start when the thinking time is over</p>

	<p>After the game starts, player can use arrow key to control his/her character. The character will have different behavior
		on different types of tiles respectively.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Ice: The most common tile type is ice tile. Character is not capable to change its momentum on ice tiles. (It might be
			interesting to give the ice tile "life point" - Ice will be thinner and eventually broken after character sliding over it.)</li>
		<li>Land: Land tiles stop the character and have it standing on it. Player now can choose one from the four possible direction.</li>
		<li>Boost spots: Boost spots are tiles that can change character's moving direction. Boost spots have four different kinds
			- pointing up, down, left and right respectively</li>
		<li>Teleportation gates: Teleportation gates appear in pairs in the board, and the pairs are identified by their color. When
			character slide into one of the teleportation gates, it will be teleported to the paired gate and keep its momentum when
			coming out of the gate. (We could also introduce "reversed gates", or "transposed gates", character's momentum will be
			altered after being teleported)</li>
		<li>Traps: Traps are tiles that are lethal to the character, the player should avoid commanding its avatar going in to this tile
			and commit suicide. </li>
		<li>Wall: When character hit the wall, its momentum will be reverted.</li>
		<li>Bonus points: Bonus points scatter all over the board. It is not essentially a specific tile, but floating above the tiles.
			User will collect the bonus points on some tiles when he slides through them.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		<b>Finish:</b>When the player lands on the goal, the round is finished and the board is re-generated as described above. (Or
		if the automatic generation process is difficult to implement, it could also be a good option to manually design
		several levels and order them in a difficulty-ascending manner)
	</p>

	<div class="figure">
		<img src="board.jpeg" style="height: 500px"/>
		<p>The board will basically look like the figure above. It is garanteed that there is at least one possible route for the
			player to finish the game</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		<b>Drawing:</b> The board is drawed in top-view, 2D, pixel style. </p>
